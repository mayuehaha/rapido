RapidoMSG
  Yet another IpMsg based on Qt and use QtWebKit for UI.

============================================================
1. How to use git and github?
  step 1. Download and install Git.
    Visit http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list and download the lastest version.
	e.g.: I'm working on Windows 7, so I download Git-1.7.9-preview20120201.exe
  step 2. Download and install TortoiseGit.
    Visit http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/downloads/list and download the lastest version.
	e.g.: I'm using 32bit Windows 7, so I download TortoiseGit-1.7.8.0-32bit.exe


2. Work on the source code...
  Once you fork this source code, you can use QtCreator to open the project file at src/rapido/rapido.pro, but because some files like Makefile and *.pro.user not under into the git version control, a messagebox will shown up and you can select your own configuration. For my working env., I select "Create Debug/Release configuration for one Qt SDK" and use VS2010 as the compiler and debuger.

3. Why I cannot debug step by step with Visual Studio 2008/2010?
  There are no default debuger, you must install one. You can download it from Microsoft website.
  for all Windows Platform, goes here and select one:

  for Windows 7, goes here:
    http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=8279
  I download winsdk_web.exe from the second link and when installing, I select "debug tool" only.

  After the debug tool installed, re-start QtCreator and open the "Options..." dialog box, select "Build and Run", and then the "Tools Chain..." tab, you will found it.
